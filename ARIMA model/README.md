# ARIMA Forecasting for Solar Energy Production in Texas (ERCOT)

## Overview

This repository focuses on time series forecasting using ARIMA models for solar production, utilizing the energy-mix dataset from ERCOT for the Texas region. The implementation incorporates seasonality breakdown and a rolling horizon technique to enhance the statistical performance of the predictions.

## Features

- **ARIMA Models:** Leverage Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average models for accurate and reliable solar production forecasts.

- **Seasonality Breakdown:** Implement a sophisticated seasonality breakdown mechanism to capture periodic patterns in the solar production data.

- **Rolling Horizon Technique:** Utilize a rolling horizon approach to adaptively update and retrain the ARIMA models, ensuring continuous improvement in forecasting accuracy.

- **ERCOT Solar Production Dataset:** Access and analyze energy-mix data from [ERCOT's official website](https://www.ercot.com/gridinfo/generation), offering a real-world case study for forecasting.
