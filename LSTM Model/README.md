# LSTM based Energy Demand Prediction for Texas with Uncertainty Quantification

## Overview

This repository presents a robust solution for predicting energy demand in Texas by leveraging advanced Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The implementation goes beyond traditional forecasting methods by incorporating a Confidence Interval (CI) formulation, integrating the innovative Monte Carlo dropout technique for uncertainty quantification.

## Features

### LSTM Models
The core of this project revolves around utilizing state-of-the-art LSTM models. These neural networks are adept at capturing intricate patterns and dependencies in time series data, making them well-suited for accurate energy demand predictions.

### Confidence Interval Formulation
To enhance the reliability of predictions, a Confidence Interval is computed. The Monte Carlo dropout technique is employed, allowing us to quantify uncertainty and provide a range of potential outcomes. This approach ensures a more comprehensive understanding of the predictive capabilities and associated risks. Helping desicion makes with risk-informed planning for peak demand.

### Texas Energy Demand Dataset
The repository is equipped with a comprehensive dataset specifically curated for the Texas region's energy demand. This real-world data serves as the foundation for training and testing the LSTM models, ensuring practical applicability and relevance.
